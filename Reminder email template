Hi Developers

 You have been selected and invited to BreatheCodeâ€™s foundation meetup. You are part of this list and we really want to start working together.

That is why I would like to personally invite you to this meetup and discuss further on how can we make this project succeed. Here is the proposed agenda for the meeting:

1. Present ourselves (know each other).
2. Read agenda and add any additional topics.
3. Discuss/update the proposed meetup objectives.
4. Discuss/update needed resources and offer anything at our disposal.
5. Discuss/update how the meetup will work and delegate responsibilities.
(Optional) 
6. Set a new date to have another meeting to continue working.

I really hope to see everyone there, an be able to work together, please find the agenda and foundation act attached 

Best,

Alejandro Sanchez
